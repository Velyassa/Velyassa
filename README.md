- 👋 Hi, I’m @Velyassa. Graduated from a community college in Spring of 2021 with a Associates in Applied Science.
My major was software development where I was taught Python, C++, JAVA, SQL, HTML 5, CSS. I am going through the 
books I had gotten in school and going through the challenges and doing them all is my current goal. I am unsure
as to what to do so far as a simple or small project for myself, wanting to get into the field of programming.
- 👀 I’m interested in learning more really.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning well, at least touching up on Python.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing right now.
- 📫 How to reach me ...
